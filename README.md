# Panoramic Views of Goryeo St
This project documents the evolution of multilingual signage within the border
city of Dandong, China. Within the confined sample area of GORYEO ST, these
signs are read by an audience that handles about a quarter of North Korea’s
external economic trade (legal/illegal) under cover of Chinese relative freedom.
Within these unique contexts emerge distinctive lived experiences, narratives,
and dialogues, that are all reflected within its language use.

By visualizing the text and photographs collected from 500+ signages within
the past decade (2014-2024), the goal is to invite the viewer to partake in an
interactive journey of exploring this complex intersection of contexts, explore
the ways in which broader systems, factors, and influences are reflected in
these visual components, and then bring these reflections into our own, or
other similar spaces.

Through visual ethnographic research, I explore an inquiry based investigation
on how one’s language identity engages with a politically sensitive world.
Gaining familiarity with the people and cultural makeup of the area prompts
us to consider how identities are shaped, making it important to share these
distant and obscured narratives with the western audiences on the other side
of the wall.
